Welcome to the Fake Meme Coin DApp! This project is designed to educate users on how to securely interact with Phantom Wallet and Solana blockchain, while avoiding common scams such as wallet drainers.

A few months ago, I was drained like an idiot by connecting my wallet to a supposed pre-sale of a memecoin. I lost about $2,000 due to that mistake. So, I dedicated myself to researching how it works and I'm sharing it with you.
Please use this only as educational content. Society is full of people looking to benefit by taking advantage of others, and we as programmers have a duty to educate and not harm. So, play with this but NEVER USE IT FOR EVIL.

If it's not running on a server, it won't work. You will always see the Phantom wallet error because it doesn't function locally unless you make the adjustment.
